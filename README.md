# Orca
Orca is a new agent language designed to decompose a complete task into multi-step agent actions. It combines the certainty of Ando workflow with the flexibility of a fully autonomous agent. The description of workflow in natural language can be adapted to the scenarios of tasks of different complexity, which increases the robustness of the agent system and improves the generalization of workflow.
